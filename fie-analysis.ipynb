    "## I. Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "For this machine project, we work with the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) 2012 Volume 1, published by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). This nationally representative dataset contains detailed information on the expenditures of Filipino households across a wide range of categories such as food, housing, education, health, transportation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each record in the dataset represents a household, with variables describing both their socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., income, region, household size, urban/rural classification) and itemized expenditure data. We're particularly interested in how these expenditure patterns relate to factors like income level, location, and household demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns in how Filipino families spent their money in 2012 and what these patterns may tell us about their socioeconomic realities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data collection method\n",
    "\n",
    "The FIES 2012 was conducted in two rounds: the first visit in July 2012, covering spending from January to June, and the second visit in January 2013, covering July to December. Each household was surveyed twice to account for seasonal variations in spending behavior, particularly for items like food and utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PSA used a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling method based on the 2003 Master Sample design. Households were randomly selected from Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), which were typically barangays or combinations of barangays. In total, around 50,000 households across all 17 regions of the Philippines were included in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of analysis is the household, as defined by shared residence and common food consumption. While the survey was primarily answered by the household head, it is assumed to represent the expenditures of the entire household.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dataset was designed for national policymaking, it includes survey weights to ensure results are representative of the entire Filipino population. We'll take these into account during analysis, especially when estimating proportions or making regional comparisons."
